            <h2>A Road to my goal</h2>
            <p> Actually, I want to be a programmer after graduating from university. Why do I want to be a programmer? I noticed that work as a programmer in a company can get a very high salary. That's really attractive to become a programmer. It's only a joke~ Be true, I already like playing and using computer when I was small. I remember that once I accidentally press the F12 on the keyboard and I saw there's many difficult words and numbers on the left-hand side on my monitor. That makes me really confuse and I decided to figure out what is it. After that, I started to learn the program by myself. In secondary school, I chose the subject ICT(Information Communication Technology)and the SBA of this subject is asked me to make a website with typing programe(HTML). Because I've already studied the program by myself, it makes more easily to designing and making this website. After the DSE, I found that there is a course call Business Information Technology in SCOPE. At this moment, there's one sentence in my mind. "This is it, where I improve my programming skills". After I graduate from SCOPE, I hope I can work as a programmer and continue working with the program. </p>

          <p> Studying this course, there's two major elements, IT and Business. I think the way to improve IT and business theory is to have to read more and practice more. I can read more of the lecture notes and extracurricular books. For the program, I can download some programming editor(E.g. Dreamweaver, Brackets, eclipse) to practice programming. And I will also visit professional programmers blog or videos and learn from it. </p>
